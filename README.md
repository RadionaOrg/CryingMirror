# CryingMirror

If it is lonely and doesn not detect human presence mirror shows crying gif. If it detects human being it transforms itself in normal mirror, but in turn takes your photo and store it in permanent memory. 

All pictures are stored at http://radiona.org/crying-mirror/ website. I have added optocoupler connected to rasp to power backlight on and off.
